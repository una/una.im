<p>Analogies always help me with comprehension. And this one, explaining git, is Holiday Flavored :)</p>

<p>So, lets say you are making holiday gifts. You and your sibling want to make baskets for your friends and family, filled with homemade cookies, candy, and trinkets.</p>

<p>Baking the cookies is you doing your work. When you&#8217;re finished baking them, you can add them to your basket (<strong>git add</strong>).</p>

<p>You can also remove(<strong>git rm</strong>) cookies or rearrange them. The basket is your <strong>staging area</strong>.</p>

<p>A git merge occurs when you add the brownies that your brother has been baking to the basket.</p>

<p>When you commit (<strong>git commit</strong>), you are wrapping up the basket with a pretty bow and a nice holiday card (your <strong>commit message</strong>).</p>

<p>You can do a <strong>git rebase</strong> to correct any errors. Say you forgot to add the candy canes! A rebase is when you unwrap the gift, change something in it, and rewrap it with a new bow and message.</p>

<p>A <strong>git push</strong> is when you are giving the basket away to your Mom or other recipient, and <strong>git clone</strong> is a whole other story. It is taking a finished set of baskets and making a perfect copy of it.
<br><br>
We&#8217;ll leave that kind of magic to Santa. <strong>Happy Holidays!!</strong></p>
