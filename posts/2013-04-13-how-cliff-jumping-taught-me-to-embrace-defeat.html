<p><span>A few months ago, I found myself in a beautiful place.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course I didn&#8217;t think twice when someone said we were going cliff jumping. I&#8217;m always down for an adventure and this trip was all about trying new things. Excited and energized, I scaled a seriously rocky cliffside and somehow arched my body, taking a few scratches along the way, to find myself staring straight down a 50-foot cliff above the Mediterranean. Yep &#8212; there I was, elated that I had finally made it, and with no option of climbing back down, I jumped .</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>The entire experience was absolutely exhilarating, but also exhausting and completely terrifying &#8212; and honestly &#8212; in the end, it wasn&#8217;t even that fun. After I jumped, I got this vicious bruise right on the base of my coccyx (look it up!) that prevented me from comfortably sitting for a few weeks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>If you think about it, we do things like this every day. We get ass bruises. We have a brilliant idea and think its the &#8220;next best thing&#8221; and get so excited about it that nothing phases us until we find ourselves finally at that peak. And it&#8217;s not always well received. We get our asses metaphorically bruised by reality, or by a client saying that our mockup looks like shit, and that our idea is stupid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>Yes, these situations kind of suck, but we learn from them! Seriously. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>I never complained about the butt bruise because it gave me a chance to feel that rush of excited energy along the way. The design/dev process parallels this: we fall into these manias where we simply can&#8217;t stop building, and those are the moments in which we learn and achieve the most. So fuck whoever isn&#8217;t using your brilliant plan &#8212; the important thing is that you made it, you did it, and you learned from it. And it&#8217;ll help you expand for your next project, which will be that much easier for you to build on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span>So don&#8217;t be afraid to fail (read: fall on your ass)! And fail proudly! Each failure is a success story in progress.</span></p>
